* CMake based install

To install via cmake do:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
mkdir /path/to/some/build/directory
cd /path/to/some/build/directory
cmake /path/to/nuosc
make all install
#+END_EXAMPLE

To control where things are installed modify the above =cmake= command like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/path/to/install/area
#+END_EXAMPLE


* SCons based install

To install you need scons.  Install that and type:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
scons [--prefix=/path/to/install/prefix]
#+END_EXAMPLE

This will build a "libnuosc++.so" shared library and main executable
"nuosc" that will be runable from the build directory:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
./nuosc -h
#+END_EXAMPLE

If the '--prefix' option is given then things will be installed in
some other location.


* Obsolete autoconf/automake install

There is also an old autoconf/automake build system but suffers from
bitrot and archaisms.  If you want to try it, expect problems.
