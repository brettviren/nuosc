 libnuosc++ - A library for calculating 3 neutrino oscillation probabilities.

"Step" methods solve the evolution ODE dnu/dx = (-i/(2E)UM^2Udagger +
V)nu(x) by stepping the neutrino from start to finish using a variety
of steppers.  The best and default is an adaptive step size
Runge-Kutta 5th order stepper.  

"Matrix" method (where applicable) solve the ODE directly.  This is
only possible with oscillations in vacuum and constant matter density.


A note on anti-neutrinos: CP symetry is broken in that the matter
potential and the CP phase changes sign between neutrino and
anti-neutrino cases.  In the code this is handled inside by the
OscParam object via OscParam::set_antineutrino().  This unfortunately
mixes the idea of oscillation parameters (which are fundamental) with
the particular neutrino which is being evolved.  When asking OscParam
for a matrix via get_mixing_matrix() or get_matter_matrix() one will
have this -1 applied if using anti neutrinos.  However, the angle
returned via get_deltacp() will *NOT*.  When using these two matrices
for the evolution equation solution, one does not need to worry about
nu/antinu issues.  This is how nuosc_prob.cc functions behave.
