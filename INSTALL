SCons based install
===================

To install you need scons.  Install that and type:

  scons [--prefix=/path/to/install/prefix]

This will build a "libnuosc++.so" shared library and main executable
"nuosc" that will be runable from the build directory:

 ./nuosc -h

If the '--prefix' option is given then things will be installed in
some other location.


Obsolete autoconf/automake install
==================================

There is also an old autoconf/automake build system but suffers from
bitrot and archaisms.  If you want to try it, expect problems.
